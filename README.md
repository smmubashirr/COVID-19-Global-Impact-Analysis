# COVID-19 Global Impact Analysis

## About the Analysis:

In this project, I aim to explore the global impact of COVID-19 using a clean dataset of reported cases. The analysis focuses on both WHO regions and country-level trends in confirmed, recovered, and death cases.

Before diving into visualizations and insights, I will begin by exploring the dataset, checking for missing values, verifying datatypes, and creating useful features. Once the data is clean and well-structured, I proceed to:

- Analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 across WHO regions.
- Identify the top countries with the most active cases.
- Visualize the distribution of confirmed and active cases.
- Highlight patterns and draw conclusions based on trends in the data

The goal of this project is not only to practice data cleaning and visualization but also to understand how different parts of the world were affected during the pandemic.

## About the Dataset:

A cleaned and combined dataset is used that provides day-to-day country-wise records of COVID-19 cases. Note that it does not include county, state, or province-level data in detail, although a Province/State column exists (often empty).

It contains the following initial columns:
- Province/State
- Country/Region
- Lat, Long
- Date
- Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, Active
- WHO Region
